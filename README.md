# Genome-wide analysis of anterior-posterior mRNA regionalization in Stentor coeruleus reveals a role for the microtubule cytoskeleton

This repository accompanies version 3 of our manuscript, Genome-wide analysis of anterior-posterior mRNA regionalization in Stentor coeruleus reveals a role for the microtubule cytoskeleton. The file paths in all of these scripts reflect the local environment on Ashley's computer and would have to be changed if you choose to utilize this code. We are continuing to work on making this analysis more reproducible as we continue to update the accompanying preprint-in-progress. _Stentor_ are giant unicellular ciliates that are capable of regenerating and are lined with parallel bundles of unidirectional microtubules. Our study shows that mRNA are regionalized along the anterior-posterior axis of _Stentor_, and this likely depends on the microtubule cytoskeleton.
